# Parallel-COVID-Computations
The main project file is _project.cu_. 
No external libraries or packages should be needed to run the program. Book.h and the Data directory are both used as imports.

Since the program is made up of three sections (reading, analysis, and results) files are also provided for each individual section. 
For each section, both a sequential and parallel implementation are included.
